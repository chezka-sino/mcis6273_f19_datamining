    "## WHAT TO TURN IN\n",
    "You are being encouraged to turn the assignment in using the provided\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook.  To do so, make a directory in your Lab environment called\n",
    "`homework/hw2`.   Put all of your files in that directory.  Then zip that directory,\n",
    "rename it with your name as the first part of the filename (e.g. `maull_hw2_files.zip`), then\n",
    "download it to your local machine, then upload the `.zip` to Blackboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not know how to do this, please ask, or visit one of the many tutorials out there\n",

    "In the last HW we explore some of the bas features of Pandas with graphic and data selection.\n",
    "This time we're going to go a but deeper into Pandas ans learn about MultIndices and grouping\n",
    "data in interesting and useful ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the things that we learned from the data last time is that the majority of it are\n",
    "interesting over several dimensions.  There are the years of competition, the sex of the competitors,\n",
    "the age the competitors, country of origin, among other things.  With denser data like these, we want\n",
    "to understand some of the underlying groupings for easier access to the data.  For example,\n",
    "one might want to understand how groupings by year and age bear out on the data to explore questions\n",
    "like \"Has the number of competitors over 40 increased over the years?\"  This might be an interesting\n",
    "question to ask to explore if powerlifters continue to compete as they age since the sport is very\n",
    "difficult on one's body and requires intense continuous training to stay competitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some questions like these are also very useful to explore visually, so we'll dive into a few more\n",
    "graphical techniques to get at these answers and more.  We're going to end up with a DataFrame\n",
    "that will group our data by year, age class and sex, so we can see some of the interesting\n",
    "annual trends along each of these dimensions within the last two decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "&#167;  Let's first get a feel for the data and filter it down.  One of the main\n",
    "difficulties in dealing with large user-contributed data sets like these\n",
    "are _data consistency_ and _data quality_.  _Data consistency_ refers to\n",
    "how data is represented over time.  We can see how this becomes an issue\n",
    "when we look at the `Division` column of the dataset.  We can see with a\n",
    "relatively untrained eye to the data, that something is very wrong with\n",
    "the consistency &mdash; there are over 1300 Division designations!  When\n",
    "you look at it more closely, there are groupings that overlap.  For\n",
    "example, you will see `Masters 45-49` and `Masters 40-49` when you\n",
    "perform a `.value_counts()` on the `Divisions` column of the data (see\n",
    "supplemental notebook).  What is the difference between these two since\n",
    "they obviously overlap?\n",
